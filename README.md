# Malla Sombra y Estructuras – Web Project



This project documents the design and development of the website for **Malla Sombra y Estructuras**.  
I worked on the site using:

- **WordPress** for the overall site structure and content management.
- **CorelDRAW** and **Adobe Photoshop** for graphic design and image editing.
- **Visual Studio** for custom code integration and fine-tuning.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapted to different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Image Slideshow Gallery:** Showcases projects interactively.  
- **SEO-Oriented Structure:** Improves indexing and ranking on search engines.  
- **Gradual Online Positioning:** Strategy to increase visibility over time.

This project represents a combination of **design**, **functionality**, and **SEO optimization** to strengthen the company’s digital presence.
